My name is RÃ©mi Jaoui and I am a visiting assistant professor in the University of Notre Dame. I am working at the interaction between model theory, a branch of mathematical logic and differential algebra. 

 #Autonomous algebraic differential equations

A central object of my research are systems of autonomous algebraic differential equations which are differential equations of the form \\[ P(y,y', \ldots, y^{(n)}) =. 0 \\]
where \\(P\\) is a polynomial with complex coefficients . Such a differential equation can be represented geometrically as an algebraic variety X (defined by \\( P = 0 \\)  and \\( \frac {\partial P} {\partial x_n} \neq 0 \\) endowed with a vector field.

Similarly, one can represent differential equations appearing in classical mechanics in this form, as long as they only involve algebraic functions. This is the case of the geodesic flows, the movement of a solid and many variants of the n-body problems as long as one starts with algebraic data.  Such equations are often represented as pairs  \\( (M,v_H) \\), where \\( (M,\omega) \\) is a symplectic variety and \\( v_H \\) is the Hamiltonian function \\( H \in \mathcal O (M) \\) 


The central question we are interested in are: when can the general solution can be written using only "classical functions"? 


# Geometric stability theory

A characteristic feature of these questions is that they all admit counterparts for the model-theoretic structure associated to a differential  

  * Locate classical differential equations such as the ones appearing in classical mechanics on the map of differentially closed fields provided by Zilber's trichotomy. 
  * Develop effective tools to study the generic solutions of algebraic differential equation using geometric linearization data along a known particular solution.
  * Study the variations of the semi-minimal analysis of a differential equations in families.
