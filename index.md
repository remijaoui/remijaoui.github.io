My name is RÃ©mi Jaoui and I am a visiting assistant professor in the University of Notre Dame. I am working at the interaction between model theory, a branch of mathematical logic and differential algebra. 

 #Autonomous algebraic differential equations

A central object of my research are systems of autonomous algebraic differential equations for example of the form \\[ P(y,y', \ldots, y^{(n)}) =. 0 \\]
where \\(P\\) is a polynomial with complex coefficients . Such a differential equation can be represented geometrically as an algebraic variety X (defined by \\( P = 0 \\)  and \\( \frac {\partial P} {\partial x_n \neq 0 \\).

An advantage of this geometric presentation such as the Hamiltonian systems associated 
Such a geometric presentation has the advantage of explicitly   and To emphasize the geometry of the situation, we will represent such equations as algebraic vareities X endowed with a vector field   
From the point of view of differential algebra, my research concerns algebraic integrability and trasncendence o. The simples case can be considered as follows:

  * Locate classical differential equations such as the ones appearing in classical mechanics on the map of differentially closed fields provided by Zilber's trichotomy. 
  * Develop effective tools to study the generic solutions of algebraic differential equation using geometric linearization data along a known particular solution.
  * Study the variations of the semi-minimal analysis of a differential equations in families.
