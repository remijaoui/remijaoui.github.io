My name is Rémi Jaoui and I am a CNRS researcher working in the <a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=fr"> Institut Camille Jordan </a> in the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 on the interaction between model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, and differential algebra. 

Previously, I was a postdoc in the <a href="https://logik.mathematik.uni-freiburg.de/index.html?l=en"> Department of Mathematical Logic </a> of the University of Freiburg (Germany), in the
 <a href="https://math.nd.edu"> Department of Mathematics </a> of the University of Notre Dame (United States) for two years and in  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/pure-mathematics/"> Department of  Pure Mathematics </a> of the University of Waterloo (Canada) for two years.  
 
I defended my PhD on June 2017 in <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/"> the University of Orsay </a> under the supervision of Jean-Benoît Bost and Martin Hils.
