A variety of common markup showing how the theme styles them.

  * Locate classical differential equations such as the ones appearing in classical mechanics on the map of a differentially closed field provided by Zilber's trichotomy. 
  * Develop effective tools to study the generic solutions of algebraic differential equation using a linearization procedure along a known particular solution.
  * Study how the model-theoretic properties of a differential equation vary in family
