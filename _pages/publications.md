## Preprints

* _On the density of strongly minimal algebraic vector fields_, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06362) , 51 pages (submitted)

It is shown that ''most'' complex algebraic vector fields define strongly minimal and geometrically trivial differential equations.  

## Publications

* _Abelian reduction in differential-algebraic and bimeromorphic geometry_ with Rahim Moosa,  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07515) , to appear in Annales de l'institut Fourier (2024). 

We prove Galois-theoretic generalizations of several results of Fujiki concerning the biremeromorphic geometry of compact complex manifolds.

* _On the equations of Poizat and Liénard_ with James Freitag, Dave Marker and Joel Nagloo [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03838). Published in International Mathematical Research Notices 2023, no. 19, pp. 16478–16539.

We study the equations of Poizat from the perspective of geometric stability theory and obtain a full classification of the algebraic relations between solutions of such equations


* _The degree of nonminimality is at most two_ with James Freitag and Rahim Moosa, 

* On the density of strongly minimal algebraic vector fields, (arXiv)[] , 51 pages (submitted)
