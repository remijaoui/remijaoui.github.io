## On the problem of integration in finite terms for exponentially algebraic functions

I have been working during the last two years with Jonathan Kirby on the problem of integration in finite terms for exponentially algebraic functions. The paper is still in preparation but here are the slides of two talks below summarize the main ideas of this work. 

* The talk was part of the DART XII conference in Kassel, Germany (April 2024)
* The talks was part of the Model Theory and Applications to Groups and Combinatorics conference in the CIRM (October 2024)



## On the density of strongly minimal algebraic vector fields

Here is a link to a preprint which concerns the construction of many strongly minimal algebraic vector fields. Together with a paper of Devilbiss and Freitag, this answers a long standing open questions formulated by Poizat around 1981.

* The talk was part of the DART XI conference in London, England (July 2023)
* The talks was part of the Model Theory conference in the Wroclaw (September 2023)
