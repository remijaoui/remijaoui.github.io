Abstract: We define the notion of a smooth pseudo-Riemannian algebraic variety \( (X,g) \) over a field k of characteristic 0, which is an algebraic analogue of the notion of Riemannian manifold and we study, from a model-theoretic perspective, the algebraic differential equation describing the geodesics on                 \( (X,g) \). 
When k is the field of real numbers, we prove that if the real points of X are Zariski-dense in X and if the real analytification of \( (X,g) \) is a compact Riemannian manifold with negative curvature, then the algebraic differential equation describing the geodesics on \( (X,g) \) is absolutely irreducible and its generic type is orthogonal to the constants.
