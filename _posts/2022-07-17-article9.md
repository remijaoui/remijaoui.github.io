<b> Abstract </b> : Several results on the birational geometry of algebraic vector fields in
characteristic zero are obtained. In particular, (1) it is shown that if some
cartesian power of an algebraic vector field admits a nontrivial rational first
integral then already the second power does, (2) two-dimensional isotrivial
algebraic vector fields admitting no nontrivial rational first integrals are
classified up to birational equivalence, (3) a structural dichotomy is
established for algebraic vector fields (of arbitrary dimension) whose finite
covers admit no nontrivial factors, and (4) a necessary condition is given on
the Albanese map of a smooth projective algebraic variety in order for it to
admit an algebraic vector field having no nontrivial rational first integrals.
