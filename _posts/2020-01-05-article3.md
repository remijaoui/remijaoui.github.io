Abstract: In this article, we develop a geometric framework to study the notion of semi-minimality for the generic type of a smooth autonomous differential equation  \\( (X,v) \\) , based on the study of rational factors of   \\( (X,v) \\) and of algebraic foliations on  \\( X \\) , invariant under the Lie-derivative of the vector field \\( v \\).


We then illustrate the effectiveness of these methods by showing that certain autonomous algebraic differential equation of order three defined over the field of real numbers --- more precisely, those associated to mixing, compact, Anosov flows of dimension three --- are generically disintegrated.
