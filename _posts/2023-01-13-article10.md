<b> Abstract </b> : Two theorems witnessing the abundance of geometrically trivial strongly minimal autonomous differential equations of arbitrary order are shown. The first one states that a generic algebraic vector field of degree \\( d  > 1 \\)  on the affine space of dimension \\( n  > 1 \\) is  strongly minimal and geometrically trivial. The second one states that if \\(X_0\\) is the complement of a smooth hyperplane section \\( H_X \\) of a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension \\( n > 1 \\) then for \\(d \\) sufficiently large, the system of differential equations associated with a generic vector field on \\( X_0 \\) with poles of order at most \\( d \\) along \\( H_X \\) is also strongly minimal and geometrically trivial.
