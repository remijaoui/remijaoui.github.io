<b> Abstract </b> : Two theorems witnessing the abundance of geometrically trivial strongly minimal autonomous differential equations of arbitrary order are shown. The first one states that a generic algebraic vector field of degree \\( d \\) greater or equal to two  on the affine space of dimension \\( n \\) greater or equal to two is strongly minimal and geometrically trivial.
