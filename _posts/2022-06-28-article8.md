<b> Abstract </b> :  It is shown that if \\( p \\) is a complete type of Lascar rank at least 2 over \\( A \\), in the theory of differentially closed fields of characteristic zero, then there exists a pair of realisations, \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\), such that \\( p \\) has a nonalgebraic forking extension over \\( A,a_1,a_2 \\). Moreover, if A is contained in the field of constants then \\( p \\) already has a nonalgebraic forking extension over \\( A,a_1 \\). The results are also formulated in a more general setting.
